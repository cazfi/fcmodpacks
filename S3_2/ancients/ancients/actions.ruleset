; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.
