About Back in Time 3:
In it's heyday the C64 had one of the best soundchips (the SID) an 8-bit computer could have in the 80's. This allowed computer musicians like Rob Hubbard, Martin Galway, Ben Daglish and others to create some amazing tunes. Those tunes have been given a new lease life with professionally done covers. BiT3 will bring back some good old memories if you've been a C64 owner and introduce a new public to some of the classics of the C64 era.
