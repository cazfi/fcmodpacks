Chess is a tileset for Freeciv created by Xin Yu.

This tileset is released under the GNU General Public License (the same
license as Freeciv itself). For more information on the license, see
COPYING.

This tileset is inspired by the Stratege tileset and by the game Kriegspiel.

It is recommended to use the citybar with this tileset. (Unless you like
staring at white-on-white writing.)

Thanks to the creators of the Amplio and Trident tilesets for letting me
use them as a template. Thanks also to Daniel Markstedt for helping me
convert the tileset to a format suitable for Freeciv 2.3, and for sundry
legal advice.
